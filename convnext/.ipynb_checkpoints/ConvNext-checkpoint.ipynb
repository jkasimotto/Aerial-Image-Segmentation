    "Because Jupyter notebooks produce output in the cells which is rendered in HTML, these appear as diffs when pushing/pulling/merging with Git. To overcome this I installed [nbstripout](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout) which removes all the output of notebooks so essentially we see the changes in the code only. **NOTE** I don't know if this automatically works for you too! I suggest watching this [4 minute nbstripout screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEMP4xacrVc) before pushing any changes to the repo."

    "The first step in my opinion is to get **any** model working on **any** semantic segmentation problem. Therefore before implementing the model on the Rareplanes dataset, I want to first implement it on thge [ADE20K dataset](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/datasets/ADE20K/index.html#Download) which has already been done by facebook research. Reproducing this will help us understand how the model and the program works. \n",
