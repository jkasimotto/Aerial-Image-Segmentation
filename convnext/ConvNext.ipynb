    "> Here we attempt to implement the **ConvNeXt** model from Facebook research. The [repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ConvNeXt) is well documented with links to: the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03545) , a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzCjXqFnWPE) explaining the model, a [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CBYTIZ4tBMsVL5cqu9N_-Q3TBprqsfEO?usp=sharing#scrollTo=wG6sydYcOJcv) with an example of object detection and [instructions](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ConvNeXt/tree/main/semantic_segmentation) for the *downstream* task of **semantic segmentation**"

    "Because Jupyter notebooks produce output in the cells which is rendered in HTML, these appear as diffs when pushing/pulling/merging with Git. To overcome this I installed [nbstripout](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout) which removes all the output of notebooks so essentially we see the changes in the code only. **NOTE** I don't know if this automatically works for you too! I suggest watching this [4 minute nbstripout screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEMP4xacrVc) before pushing any changes to the repo."
